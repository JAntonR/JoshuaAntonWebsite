Hello past me. You might be wondering why there is a gap between the last time I committed to this repo and now. It is because I have recently started a job at Klintax? I don't remember the name all too well but you might since it is the job you will be working for 8 months at as a COOP. Today is the first day and you have been taking the week before to relax. It has been a long time since you have been in an office setting. It might be hard and stressful but keep going and don't give up. This is a great opportunity and honestly so far as a first day, it isn't that bad.
